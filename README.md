# Beer he's been drinking
Tutorial at https://github.com/austinlyons/dcjs-leaflet-untappd, using d3, dc, and crossfilter (not to mention leaflet) javascript libraries to map differences between beers the tutorial author has tasted across the world.  One of the better tutorials I've done, and certainly more entertaining than most.

###No CDNs?    

Source files are included for all the libraries used - living overseas at the time I'm doing this, power (and internet connection) goes out on occasion, so files need to be included to ensure the page works.  This includes bootstrap.css, crossfilter.js, d3.js, dc.js and leaflet.js files and respective .css files where necessary.  And underscore, which the author uses and which I haven't used enough at this point.
