Tutorial at https://github.com/austinlyons/dcjs-leaflet-untappd, using d3, dc, and crossfilter javascript libraries (not to mention leaflet).    

Living overseas at the time I'm doing this and power (and internet connection) goes out on occasion, so am includinng files for all dependencies:  bootstrap, crossfilter.js, d3.js, dc.js, and leaflet.js.  And underscore, which the author uses and which I haven't used enough at this point.
